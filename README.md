  #requirements
  "&#x1F3D7; What is needed prior to making use of this repository"


Access to GitHub Actions if using on GitHub, or manually assigning environment variables prior to running `npm test`.

## Quick Start

  #quick-start
  "&#9889; Perhaps as easy as one, 2.0,..."

## Notes
[notes]:
  #notes
  "&#x1F5D2; Additional notes and links that may be worth clicking in the future"


This Action is intended for committing _local_ Workspace repository changes, and does **not** assume that an immediate push is wanted; Pull Requests are certainly welcomed if bugs are found, or more commit related Inputs translation are desired.


---


The commit author defaults to user name of `gha-utilities` and email of `actions@github.com`, may be modified within your Workflows as well as selecting a subset of staged paths to commit...


```YAML
      - name: Workspace Commit
        uses: gha-utilities/workspace-commit@v0.0.4
        with:
          paths: |
            README.md
            index.js
            etc
          message: Updates compiled site files
          author: ${{ github.author }}
          email: name@example.com
```


... At which point running `git commit` directly from a Workflow without this action may be shorter for one-line commit messages...


```YAML
      - name: Commit Changes
        run: |
          git -c "user.name ${{ github.actor }}"\
              -c "user.email name@example.com"\
              README.md\
              index.js\
              etc\
              commit "_message_"
```


---


If `user.name` and/or `user.email` are assigned prior to running `gha-utilities/workspace-commit`, then it _should_ still be possible to temporarily overwrite either for an individual commit...


```YAML
      - name: Configure Git user.name
        run: git config user.name Your_GitHub_Name

      - name: Configure Git user.email
        run: git config user.email Your_GitHub_Email

      # ...

      - name: Commit changes
        with: gha-utilities/workspace-commit@v0.0.4
          author: ${{ github.author }}
          email: name@example.com
          message: Updates compiled site files
          all: true
```


... In such cases the `user.name` and/or `user.email` configurations will be reverted values set prior to commit action.


**Notice** in cases where the `user.name` and/or `user.email` configurations where **not** set prior to running the `gha-utilities/workspace-commit` action, then configurations will persist!


---


Multi-line commit messages are possible from Workflow file(s), and _should_ also allow for environment variables...


```YAML
      - name: Workspace Commit
        uses: gha-utilities/workspace-commit@v0.0.4
        env:
          COMMIT_MESSAGE_FOOTER: This commit was applied automatically from an Action
        with:
          all: true
          message: >
            Updates compiled site files

            ${COMMIT_MESSAGE_FOOTER}
```


---


Local testing of this Action is possible by defining environment variables...


```Bash
GITHUB_ACTOR='User_Name'\
  GITHUB_REPOSITORY='organization/repository'\
  INPUT_AUTHOR='Git_Name'\
  INPUT_EMAIL='Email_Name@example.com'\
  INPUT_MESSAGE='test workspace-commit index.js'\
  INPUT_PATHS='file.ext'\
  node ~/git/hub/gha-utilities/workspace-commit/index.js
```
